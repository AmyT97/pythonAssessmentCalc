Task 1 - Write an algorithm using an appropriate design notation (pseudocode) which will input one student's coursework mark and prelim mark and calculate and display their percentage and grade.
Remember to show data flow and ensure that the input is validated. 

Part 1 - pseudocode

1. input one student's coursework mark
2. input one student's prelim mark 
3. calculate percentage 
4. compare percentage with marking scheme and display grade using a series of IF statements 

Part 2 - stepwise refinement 

1.1 PRINT enter students coursework mark
1.2 DO
1.3     GET courseWorkMark
1.4 WHILE < 0 OR > 60

2.1 PRINT enter students prelim mark
2.2 DO
2.3     GET prelimMark 
2.4 WHILE < 0 OR > 90

3.1 CALCULATE percentage = (courseWorkMark + prelimMark)*100/150

4.1 IF percentage > 70% 
        PRINT grade A
    ELSE IF percentage > 60% OR < 69%
        PRINT grade B
    ELSE IF percentage > 50% OR < 59% 
        PRINT grade C
    ELSE IF percentage > 45% OR <49%
        PRINT grade D 
    ELSE percentage <45% 
        PRINT grade no award
