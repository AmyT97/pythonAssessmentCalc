Description - Task 8 Fetch-Execute Cycle

The CPU is the brain of the computer and executes instructions.
It consists of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), and registers.
The Control Unit coordinates the fetch-execute cycle by fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and executing them.
The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations as instructed by the fetched instructions.

The computer processes the program using the fetch-execute cycle. The cycle involves four steps which are grouped into twos by time. 
Within the instruction time frame (i-time) instruction are retrieved from memory and decoded by the CPU (cental processing unit) the related steps are called 'Fetch' and 'Decode':

Fetch: The CPU retrieves instructions from a systems hard disk drive (HDD) or solid state drive (SSD) and stores them in a register location which is a temporary storage location within the CPU.
Decode: At this stage the CPU determines which components are required in the execution of the instruction, outlining parameters for a successful execution. 

Within the execution time frame (e-time) program instructions are executed by the CPU with processed data information being stored the assicuated steps are called 'Execute' and 'Store':

Execute: The CPU assigns the specific actions to the revelant system components in order ro carry out the initial program instructions, processing the actual data.
Store: The newly processed is written back into the memory location on the HDD or SSD. 

The memory is saved as machine code (ones and zeros) and is categorised as either RAM (Random Access Memory) or ROM (Read Only Memory).
The first of the two being volatile memory that stores data and program instructions temporarily during execution 
and the latter stores firmware and permanent system instructions that do not change.

Buses are pathways that allow data and instructions to travel between the CPU, memory, and other components of the computer.
The primary buses involved in the fetch-execute cycle are the address bus, data bus, and control bus.
The address bus carries memory addresses, specifying the location of data or instructions in memory.
The data bus carries actual data between the CPU and memory.
The control bus carries control signals that coordinate and synchronize the activities of various components during the fetch-execute cycle.

The fetch-execute cycle goes back to the start and repeats continuously unless an error is encountered.
